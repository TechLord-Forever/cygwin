XWin - X Server for the Cygwin environment on Microsoft Windows 
<p> 
<p> 
<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Synopsis</a></h2>
<b>XWin</b>
[ options ] ... 
<p> 
<p> 
<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
<i>XWin</i> is an X Server for the X Window System on
the Cygwin environment running on Microsoft Windows. 
<p> 
<p> 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Modes</a></h2>
<i>XWin</i> can operate
in five different and incompatible modes: <br>
* <i>Single Window</i>: This is the default option.  The X server appears as a
single Windows window and all X windows are contained within this window.
 This mode requires an external window manager. <br>
* <i>No Decoration</i>: This mode is like single window mode except that the X
server window does not have a title bar or border, thus maximizing the
amount of space available for X windows within the X server window.  This
mode requires an external window manager. <br>
* <i>Full Screen</i>: This mode is like single window mode except that the X server
window takes the full screen, covering completely the Windows desktop. 
This mode requires an external window manager. <br>
* <i>Rootless</i>: The X server works on a window covering the whole screen but
the root window (traditionally covered with an X hatch pattern) is hidden
from view.  This mode requires an external window manager. <br>
* <i>Multi-Window</i>: In this mode <i>XWin</i> uses its own integrated window manager
in order to handle the top-level X windows, in such a way that they appear
as normal Windows windows. <p>
NOTE: <i>Multi-Window</i> mode will crash if an external
window manager such as <i>twm</i> or <i>fvwm</i> is launched since <i>Multi-Window</i> uses its
own internal window manager; all other modes require an external window
manager in order to move, resize, and perform other operations on the individual
X windows. 
<p> 
<p> 
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Log</a></h2>
As it runs <i>XWin</i> writes messages indicating the most relevant
events to  the console from which it was called and to a log file that
by default is located at <i>/tmp/XWin.log</i>.  This file is mainly for debugging
purposes. 
<p> 
<p> 
<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Preferences File</a></h2>
On startup <i>XWin</i> looks for the file <i>$HOME/.XWinrc</i>
or, if the previous file does not exist, <i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/system.XWinrc</i>.
 <i>.XWinrc</i> allows setting preferences for the following: <br>
1- To include items into the menu associated with the <i>XWin</i> icon which is
in the <i>Windows</i> system tray.  This functions in all modes that have a tray
icon. <br>
2- To include items in the menu which is associated with the Windows window
that <i>XWin -multiwindow</i> produces for each top-level X window.  That can be
done both for the generic case and for particular programs. <br>
3- To change the icon that is associated to the Windows window that <i>XWin
-multiwindow</i> produces for each top-level X-window.  Again, that can be done
both for the generic case and for particular programs. <p>
The format of the
<i>.XWinrc</i> file is given in the man page <a href='XWinrc.5.html'>XWinrc(5)</a>
. 
<p> 
<p> 
<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>Options</a></h2>
In addition to
the normal server options described in the <a href='Xserver.1.html'><i>Xserver(1)</i></a>
 manual page, <i>XWin</i>
accepts the following command line switches, <i>all</i> of which are optional:

<dl>

<dt><b>-clipboard</b> </dt>
<dd>Enables the integration between the Cygwin/X clipboard and Windows
clipboard.  Do not use in conjunction with the <i>xwinclip</i> program. </dd>

<dt><b>-clipupdates
<i>num_boxes</i></b> </dt>
<dd>Specify an optional threshold, above which the boxes in a shadow
update operation will be collected into a GDI clipping region.  The clipping
region is then used to do a single bit block transfer that is constrained
to the updated area by the clipping region.  There is some overhead involved
in creating, installing, destroying, and removing the clipping region,
thus there may not be much benefit for a small number of boxes (less than
10).  It is even possible that this functionality does not provide a benefit
at any number of boxes; we can only determine the usefulness of this feature
through testing. This parameter works in conjunction with engines 1, 2,
and 4 (Shadow GDI, Shadow DirectDraw, and Shadow DirectDraw Non-Locking,
respectively). </dd>

<dt><b>-emulate3buttons <i>timeout</i></b> </dt>
<dd>Emulate a three button mouse; pressing
both buttons within <i>timeout</i> milliseconds causes an emulated middle button
press.  The default  <i>timeout</i> is 50 milliseconds.  Note that most mice with
scroll wheel have middle button functionality, usually you will need this
option only if you have a two button mouse without scroll wheel. </dd>

<dt><b>-emulatepseudo</b>
</dt>
<dd>Create a depth 8 PseudoColor visual when running in depths 15, 16, 24,
or 32, collectively known as TrueColor depths.  At this date (April 2004)
this option is not still operative.<br>
 </dd>

<dt><b>-engine <i>engine_type_id</i></b> </dt>
<dd>This option, which is intended for Cygwin/X developers,
overrides the server's automatically supported engine type.  This parameter
will be ignored if the specified engine type is not supported on the current
system.  The supported engine type ids are 1 - Shadow GDI, 2 - Shadow DirectDraw,
and 4 - Shadow DirectDraw4. Additionally, there is a barely functional experimental
engine type id 16 - Native GDI. </dd>

<dt><b>-fullscreen [-depth <i>depth</i>] [-refresh <i>rate_in_Hz</i>]</b>
</dt>
<dd>Run the server in fullscreen mode, as opposed to the default windowed mode.
</dd>

<dt><b>-depth <i>depth</i></b> </dt>
<dd>Specify the color depth, in bits per pixel, to use when running
in fullscreen with a DirectDraw engine.  This parameter is ignored if <b>-fullscreen</b>
is not specified. </dd>

<dt><b>-refresh <i>rate_in_Hz</i></b> </dt>
<dd>Specify an optional refresh rate to
use when running in fullscreen with a DirectDraw engine.  This parameter
is ignored if <b>-fullscreen</b> is not specified. </dd>

<dt><b>-help</b> </dt>
<dd>Write a help text to the
console and to the log file. </dd>

<dt><b>-ignoreinput</b> </dt>
<dd>Ignore keyboard and mouse input.
 This is usually only used for testing and debugging purposes. </dd>

<dt><b>-[no]keyhook</b>
</dt>
<dd>Enable [disable] a low-level keyboard hook for catching special key combinations
like Alt+Tab and passing them to the X Server instead of letting <i>Windows</i>
handle them. </dd>

<dt><b>-lesspointer</b> </dt>
<dd>Hide the Windows mouse cursor when the mouse is
over any Cygwin/X window (regardless of whether that window is active or
inactive).  This prevents the Windows mouse cursor from being placed overtop
of the X cursor. </dd>

<dt><b>-logfile <i>File_Name</i></b> </dt>
<dd>Change the log file from the default
located at <i>/tmp/XWin.log</i> to the one indicated by <i>File_Name</i>. </dd>

<dt><b>-logverbose <i>level</i></b>
</dt>
<dd>Control the degree of verbosity of the log messages with the integer parameter
<i>level</i>.  For <i>level</i>=0 only fatal errors are reported, for <i>level</i>=1 (default)
simple information about configuration is also given, for <i>level</i>=2 a detailed
log information (including trace and debug output) is produced.  Bigger
values will yield a still more detailed debug output.  At this date (April
2004) the option is still not fully operative; the default value is 2 and
the output is insensitive to the level value. </dd>

<dt><b>-multimonitors</b> </dt>
<dd>Create a root
window that covers all monitors on a system with multiple monitors. </dd>

<dt><b>-multiwindow</b>
</dt>
<dd>Start the integrated <i>Windowsi</i>-based window manager, which launches each
top-level X window in its own <i>Windows</i> window.  Not to be used together with
<b>-rootless</b> nor <b>-fullscreen</b>. </dd>

<dt><b>-nodecoration</b> </dt>
<dd>Do not give the Cygwin/X window a
Windows window border, title bar, etc.  This parameter only applies to windowed
mode screens, i.e., this parameter is ignored when the <b>-fullscreen</b> parameter
is specified. </dd>

<dt><b>-nounicodeclipboard</b> </dt>
<dd>Do not use Unicode clipboard even if NT-based
platform. </dd>

<dt><b>-rootless</b> </dt>
<dd>Run the server in rootless mode.  Not to be used with
<b>-multiwindow</b> nor with <b>-fullscreen</b>. </dd>

<dt><b>-screen <i>screen_number</i> <i>width</i> <i>height</i></b> </dt>
<dd>This
parameter may be used to specify the <i>screen_number,</i> <i>height,</i> and <i>width</i> of
one or several Cygwin/X screens; each Cygwin/X screen will be opened in
its own window.  When using multiple screens, be sure not to duplicate any
screen numbers. <i>XWin</i> default behavior is to create a single screen that
is roughly the size of the current Windows display area. Screen specific
parameters, such as <b>-fullscreen</b>, can be applied as a default to all screens
by placing those screen specific parameters before any <b>-screen</b> parameter.
 Screen specific parameters placed after the first <b>-screen</b> parameter will
apply only to the immediately preceeding <b>-screen</b> parameter. </dd>

<dt><b>-scrollbars</b> </dt>
<dd>In
windowed mode, allow screens bigger than the Windows desktop. Moreover,
if the window has decorations, one can now resize it. </dd>

<dt><b>-[no]trayicon</b> </dt>
<dd>Do not
create a tray icon.  Default is to create one icon per screen.  You can globally
disable tray icons with <b>-notrayicon</b>, then enable it for specific screens
with <b>-trayicon</b> for those screens. </dd>

<dt><b>-[no]unixkill</b> </dt>
<dd>Enable or disable the <i>Ctrl-Alt-Backspace</i>
key combination as a signal to exit the X Server.  The <i>Ctrl-Alt-Backspace</i>
key combination is disabled by default. </dd>

<dt><b>-[no]winkill</b> </dt>
<dd>Enable or disable the
<i>Alt-F4</i> key combination as a signal to exit the X Server. The <i>Alt-F4</i> key combination
is enabled by default. </dd>

<dt><b>-swcursor</b> </dt>
<dd>Disable the usage of the windows cursor
and use the X11 software cursor instead. <b>-silent-dup-error</b> If another instance
of XWin is found running, exit silently and don't display  the error messge.
</dd>

<dt><b>-xkblayout <i>layout</i></b> </dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt><b>-xkbmodel <i>model</i></b> </dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt><b>-xkboptions <i>option</i></b> </dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt><b>-xkbrules <i>rule</i></b> </dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt><b>-xkbvariant
<i>variant</b> </i></dt>
<dd>These options implement the xkeyboard extension for loading a particular
keyboard map as the X server starts.  The behavior is similar to the <i>setxkbmap</i>
program.  The layout data is located at <i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xkb/</i>.  Additional
information is found in the README files therein and in the man page of
<i>setxkbmap</i>.  For example in order to load a German layout for a pc105 keyboard
one uses the options: <br>
<i> -xkblayout de -xkbmodel pc105</i> </dd>
</dl>
<p>
Alternatively one may use the <i>setxkbmap</i> program
after XWin is running or even the <i>xmodmap</i> program for loading the old-style
keyboard maps.

<h2><a name='sect8' href='#toc8'>Bugs</a></h2>
<i>XWin</i> and this man page still have many limitations. 
Some of the more obvious ones are: <br>
- The display mode can not be changed once the X server has started. <br>
- The XWin software is developing rapidly; it is therefore likely that this
man page is not up to date.  It is always prudent to  look also at the output
of <i>XWin -help</i> and to the Cygwin/X User Guide at /usr/share/doc/cygwin-x-doc-x.x.x/ug/cygwin-x-ug.xxx
in order to check the options that are operative.
