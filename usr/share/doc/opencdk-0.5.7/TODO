[for the 0.5.x branch]

* remove acinclude.m4 (it doesn't work with my autoconf environment)

* Include a library for random and mpi routines and then remove
  the dependency to Libgcrypt. (HIGH PRIORITY)

* Use separate makefiles for cipherlib, mdlib.

* Add the SHA1 digest of the current keyring as the first entry
  to the index files. With this new record, we can easily decide
  whether to rebuild the index or not.

* The filter stuff seems to be very slow and I can't think of any
  positive performance issues. Rethink the stuff or use GPG like
  filter stuff which works on buffer and not on FILE* structs.  

* src/main.c
** cdk_handle_set_keydb. It's not really logical that you can set
   two handle without any special params. Think of another name?
   cdk_handle_set_auto_keydb?

* src/cipher.c
** Currently we can only encode files with a maximum of 4GB. The
   libc functions only support 32 bit. We need to support partial bodies
   if the file is bigger. (partly done: implement and test the last part!)
   ts: do the same for literal packets or move these parts into
   stream.c

* src/encrypt.c
** Support multiple signatures in one file. But this has no high priority.
** Implement a way for detached sigs that allow to pass a filename of
   of the plaintext rather than strip off the extension of the sigfile.


[later]
* src/trustb.c
** I'm not really sure if we should include something which is only
   GPG specific. But this way we don't need to implement trust calculation.

* src/new-packet.c
** Find a way to make sure the copy of a secret key is also stored
   in secure memory. (We currently solve this with cloning).

* add more doc headers for the external interface.

* grep the code for all 'fixme/todo's and replace them with real code.
