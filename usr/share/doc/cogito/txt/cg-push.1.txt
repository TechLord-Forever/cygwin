cg-push(1)
==========

NAME
----
cg-push - push changes to a remote repository

SYNOPSIS
--------
cg-push [-r LOCAL_BRANCH] [-t TAG]... [REMOTE_BRANCH]...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
It will push your commits on the current branch (or as specified by
the -r option) to one or more remote repositories, provided that your
commits follow the last commit in each of the remote repositories.

Note that if a remote repository is associated with a working
tree copy, this command won't update that. Use cg-reset at the
remote side to bring it in sync (but throw away any local changes
in that tree). Consider setting up a standalone repository (see
gitlink:cg-admin-setuprepo[1]).

You can set up update hooks in the remote repository to bind
any action to the push (e.g. sending an email or CIA notification
or even verifying if the commits are well-formed before letting
them in). See `git receive-pack`(1) documentation for details.

Takes the branch names as arguments, defaulting to "origin".

OPTIONS
-------

--
-r BRANCH::
	Pushes the given branch instead of the current one. Note that
	we lie a little here and you can actually specify a particular
	commit here, but you probably will not want to do that.

-t TAG::
	Tells cg-push to also push the given tag. Note that in the
	future, cg-push should push tags automatically. Also note
	that even if you pass gitlink:cg-push[1] the '-t' arguments, your
	HEAD is still pushed as well in addition to the tags.


-h, --help::
	Print usage summary.

--long-help::
	Print user manual. The same as found in gitlink:cg-push[1].
