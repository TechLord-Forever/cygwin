cg-diff(1)
==========

NAME
----
cg-diff - show changes in the diff format

SYNOPSIS
--------
cg-diff [-c] [-m] [-s] [-p] [-r FROM_ID[..TO_ID]] [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Outputs a diff for converting the first tree to the second one.
By default compares the current working tree to the state at the
last commit. The output will automatically be displayed in a pager
unless it is piped to a program.

OPTIONS
-------

--
-c::
	Colorize the output. You can customize the colors using the
	$CG_COLORS environment variable (see below).

--diffcore ARGS::
	Pass the given diffcore arguments the called Git diff command.
	See e.g. git diff-tree(1) documentation for the list of possible
	arguments; '-R', '-B', and '-C' might be of particular interest
	('-M' is already passed by default).

--no-renames::
	By default, gitlink:cg-diff[1] will automatically detect file renames.
	Diff produced by the rename-aware gitlink:cg-diff[1] will be unappliable
	using patch(1) (you need to use gitlink:cg-patch[1]) and the renames
	detection can add slight extra performance penalty. This switch
	will turn the rename detection off.

-p::
	Show diff to the parent of the current commit (or the commit
	specified by the -r parameter).

-s::
	Summarize the diff by showing a histogram for removed and added
	lines (similar to the output of diffstat(1)) and information
	about added and renamed files and mode changes.

-r FROM_ID[..TO_ID]::
	Specify the revisions to diff using either '-r rev1..rev2' or
	'-r rev1 -r rev2'. If no revision is specified, the current
	working tree is implied. Note that no revision is different from
	empty revision which means '-r rev..' compares between 'rev' and
	'HEAD', while '-r rev' compares between 'rev' and working tree.

-m::
	Base the diff at the merge base of the -r arguments (defaulting
	to HEAD and origin).


-h, --help::
	Print usage summary.

--long-help::
	Print user manual. The same as found in gitlink:cg-diff[1].

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
PAGER::
	The pager to display log information in, defaults to `less`.

PAGER_FLAGS::
	Flags to pass to the pager.

CG_COLORS::
	Colon-separated list of 'name=color' pairs, where name is
	one of diffhdr, diffhdradd, diffhdrmod, diffhdrrem, diffadd,
	diffmod, diffrem, diffhunk, diffctx, default, and value is
	an ECMA-48 SGR sequence (see e.g. console_codes(4)).

CG_COLORS_AUTO::
	Even if -c was passed or specified in ~/.cgrc, if this option
	is set, use colors only when the output is a terminal and it
	supports colors.

CG_LESS::
	This is what the $LESS environment variable value will be set
	to before invoking $PAGER. It defaults to $LESS concatenated
	with the `R` flag to allow displaying of colorized output.

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
-----------------------
The following GIT configuration file variables are recognized:

diff.usecolor::
	If enabled, colorify the output like with -c if the output
	is a terminal.

NOTES
-----
The ':' is equivalent to '..' in revisions range specification (to make
things more comfortable to SVN users). See cogito(7) for more details
about revision specification.
