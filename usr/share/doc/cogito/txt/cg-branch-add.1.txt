cg-branch-add(1)
================

NAME
----
cg-branch-add - add new remote branch

SYNOPSIS
--------
cg-branch-add BRANCH_NAME LOCATION

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Takes the desired branch name and source location as parameters.

This command lets you add to the list of 'remote branches'. Those are
branches in your local repository which correspond to some branches
in other repositories.

After you add a remote branch, you can gitlink:cg-fetch[1] from it to get the
latest changes on the branch, as they appeared in the remote repository.

Terminology note: This command concerns remote branches, not the local
ones (those managed by gitlink:cg-switch[1]).

The possible source location specifiers are:

1. Local path - note that fetching will hardlink the objects if possible.

2. rsync - `rsync://host/path`
THE rsync REPOSITORY ACCESS METHOD IS DEPRECATED AND WILL BE REMOVED
IN THE FUTURE! The problem is that it will download _all_ data from
the remote repository, including objects which do not belong to the
one particular branch you want to fetch.

3. HTTP - `http://host/path`

4. HTTPS - `https://host/path`

5. FTP - 'ftp://host/path'

6. SSH - `git+ssh://host/path` or `host:path` (the latter can change);
note that the path must be absolute in the first case.

7. git daemon - `git://host/path`


The URL can have a fragment part, which identifies a branch inside of
the remote repository (in the form "repoURL#branchname"). Otherwise,
Cogito defaults to whatever branch the repository's HEAD points to
at the time of each fetch.

OPTIONS
-------

--



-h, --help::
	Print usage summary.

--long-help::
	Print user manual. The same as found in gitlink:cg-branch-add[1].
--

FILES
-----
$GIT_DIR/branches/BRANCH_NAME::
	Contains the source location of the remote branch.

$GIT_DIR/refs/heads/BRANCH_NAME::
	Contains pointer to the latest commit in a branch. It can be more
	conveniently retrieved using `cg-object-id BRANCH_NAME`.

EXAMPLE USAGE
-------------
Let's say you have a repository at `git+ssh://host/path/repo.git` and you
want to fetch its 'testing' branch to your local repository. In that case
you can do

	$ cg-branch-add repo-testing 'git+ssh://host/path/repo.git#testing'

and refer to it as 'repo-testing' anytime later:

	$ cg-fetch repo-testing

For example you can check the changes in the `repo-testing` branch compared
to your current branch:

	$ cg-diff -r repo-testing
