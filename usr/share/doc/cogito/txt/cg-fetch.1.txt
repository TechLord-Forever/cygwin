cg-fetch(1)
===========

NAME
----
cg-fetch - fetch changes from a remote branch to the local repository

SYNOPSIS
--------
cg-fetch [-f] [-v] [BRANCH_NAME]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Takes the branch name as an argument, defaulting to 'origin'.

This will fetch the latest changes from a remote repository to the
corresponding branch in your local repository. Note that this operation
does not involve merging those changes to your own branch - that is being
done by the gitlink:cg-merge[1] command. gitlink:cg-update[1] exists to conveniently bundle
the act of fetching and merging to your working branch together.

Before the first fetch, you have to tell Cogito about the remote branch.
This should be done by the gitlink:cg-branch-add[1] command. See its documentation
for the list of supported fetching protocols and other details. Note that
one exception to this is the 'origin' branch, which was set to the location
of the source repository if you created yours using the gitlink:cg-clone[1] command.

Note that the operation now being performed by gitlink:cg-fetch[1] ('fetching')
was called 'pulling' in the past. However, GIT recently changed this
terminology, and after sufficient transition period, the 'pulling'
expression will be instead used for the operation now performed by the
gitlink:cg-update[1] command. Please do not let this confuse you.

OPTIONS
-------

--
-f::
	Force the complete fetch even if the heads are the same.

-v::
	Display more verbose output - most notably list all the files
	touched by the fetched changes. Use twice to get even more verbosity,
	that is raw progress information instead of the progress bar.


-h, --help::
	Print usage summary.

--long-help::
	Print user manual. The same as found in gitlink:cg-fetch[1].
--


ENVIRONMENT
-----------
RSYNC::
	The command to invoke when we want to call the rsync tool (only used
	when fetching over the rsync protocol). Defaults to 'rsync'.

	Additional flags to be passed to the rsync tool when fetching over
	the rsync protocol.
