cg-mv(1)
========

NAME
----
cg-mv - rename or move files in the repository

SYNOPSIS
--------
cg-mv [-f] FILE... DEST

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Takes either two filenames and removes a file from the first one to
the second one, or a list of filenames and a dirname and moves all
the files to the directory. The changes will be executed in your working
tree immediately, but recorded to the repository only at the time of the
next commit.

Note that so far, GIT/Cogito does not track file renames/moves per se.
Therefore, doing gitlink:cg-mv[1] is currently the same as doing gitlink:cg-rm[1], gitlink:cg-add[1]
from the Cogito perspective, and no special information is recorded that
the file moved around. When any rename tracking gets involved currently,
it is purely heuristical method executed at the time of examination.
