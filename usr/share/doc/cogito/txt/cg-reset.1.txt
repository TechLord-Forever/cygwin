cg-reset(1)
===========

NAME
----
cg-reset - reset the state of the working tree

SYNOPSIS
--------
cg-reset [--adds-removes]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Reverts the working tree to a consistent state before any changes to it
(including merges etc.) were done. This command will rebuild the state
of the tree according to the commit of .git/refs/heads/master, so if your
working tree got into basically any inconsistent state, this will cure it.

Basically, this is the opposite of gitlink:cg-commit[1] in some sense.

This command is complementary to gitlink:cg-restore[1], which only brings
individual files in sync with their state at the time of the
last commit.

OPTIONS
-------

--
--adds-removes::
	Reset ONLY the so-called "index" file. This effectively means that
	any adds and removes you did will be unrecorded (but if you removed
	the file physically as well, that will not be undone - run
	'cg-restore' to restore it physically afterwards).


-h, --help::
	Print usage summary.

--long-help::
	Print user manual. The same as found in gitlink:cg-reset[1].
