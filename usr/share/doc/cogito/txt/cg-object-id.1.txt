cg-object-id(1)
===============

NAME
----
cg-object-id - get the sha1 id of an object associated with the given symbolic id

SYNOPSIS
--------
cg-object-id [-b | -c | -d | -n | -p | -t] [OBJECT_ID]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Resolves a given symbolic id to the raw SHA1 id (or a symbolic
description when passed the '-d' parameter). The symbolic id can be
an SHA1 id, a unique starting segment of an existing SHA1 id, a ref
name, date, empty string, etc. See the 'COMMIT_ID' description in
cogito(7) for the full list.

Normally, you do not use this command directly (except with the '-d'
parameter), but it is used in other Cogito scripts to resolve passed
object identifiers. If the ID is not provided, HEAD is assumed.  The
default behavior is to show the commit ID, but you should always
explicitly write '-c' if using this in a script.

OPTIONS
-------

--
-b::
	Get name of the current branch.

-c::
	Get ID of commit matching the object ID (error out if it is not
	a commit). This is the default if you do not pass any parameter
	as well, but that is only for the human usage. For clarity, all
	scripted usage of cg-object-id should use -c explicitly if it
	wants a commit.

-d::
	Get a commit description in form of a short string. It shows the
	most recent tag in past of the commit and if it is not the commit
	itself, it appends first few chars of the commit id to id. See
	`git describe`(1) for details.

-n::
	Normalize only - don't check the object type.

-p::
	Get ID of the first parent commit of a given revision or HEAD.
	NOTE: Multiple SHA1s separated by newlines will be returned for
	commits with multiple parents.

-t::
	Get ID of tree associated with given commit or HEAD.

OBJECT_ID::
	An ID resolving to a commit.


-h, --help::
	Print usage summary.

--long-help::
	Print user manual. The same as found in gitlink:cg-object-id[1].
