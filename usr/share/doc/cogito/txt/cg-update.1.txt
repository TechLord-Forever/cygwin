cg-update(1)
============

NAME
----
cg-update - fetch and merge changes from a remote repository

SYNOPSIS
--------
cg-update [-f] [--squash] [-v] [BRANCH_NAME]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Takes the branch name as an argument, defaulting to 'origin'.

This is similar to running cg-fetch and cg-merge commands successively.
Please refer to the documentation of those commands for more details
about the operation. Note that if you are not doing own development
but only following some project, it is recommended to use this command
instead of gitlink:cg-fetch[1] + gitlink:cg-merge[1] since gitlink:cg-update[1] can handle some
additional corner cases (in particular, if the remote branch rebases,
gitlink:cg-update[1] will fast-forward instead of doing a tree merge and diverging).

Note that in the GIT newspeak, the operation being performed by cg-update
is now called 'pull', even though in the past, 'pull' was the name for
the operation being now done by cg-fetch, which is even still aliased
to cg-pull. Please do not let this confuse you. (Cogito won't call this
'update' operation 'pull', since about everyone but GIT and BK users uses
it in the 'fetch' meaning.)

OPTIONS
-------

--
-f::
	Force the complete fetch even if the heads are the same.

--squash::
	"Squash" merge - condense all the to-be-merged commits to a single
	merge commit. This is not to be used lightly; see the cg-merge
	documentation for further details.

-v::
	Display more verbose output - most notably list all the files
	touched by the pulled changes.


-h, --help::
	Print usage summary.

--long-help::
	Print user manual. The same as found in gitlink:cg-update[1].

ENVIRONMENT
-----------
CGFETCH_FLAGS::
	Additional flags to pass cg-fetch (useful e.g. for -v -v).
