cg-tag(1)
=========

NAME
----
cg-tag - mark certain commit with a tag

SYNOPSIS
--------
cg-tag [-m MESSAGE]... [-e] [-s] [OTHER_OPTIONS] TAG_NAME [OBJECT_ID]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Creates a tag referencing the given commit (or 'HEAD'). You can then
use the tag anywhere you specify a commit or tree ID.

cg-tag will try to sign the tag if you give it the -s option.
You can override the default key choice by passing it the -k argument.

Takes the tag name and optionally the associated ID as arguments.
When the standard input is not a terminal, it will accept the tag
description on stdin.

OPTIONS
-------

--
-e::
	Open editor for the tag description message.

-f::
	This will make cg-tag silently overwrite the tag if it already
	exists.

-m MESSAGE::
	Message associated with the tag, describing it. Multiple -m
	parameters will cause several description paragraphs to appear.

-M FILE::
	Include tag description message from a file (this has the same
	effect as if you would cat it to stdin).

-k KEYNAME::
	Use the given key to sign the tag, instead of the default one.
	You can use any key identifier GPG recognizes - the argument
	is passed verbatim as the '--default-key' argument to GPG.

-s::
	Sign the tag by your private key using GPG.

OBJECT_ID::
	This is most usually the ID of the commit to tag. Tagging
	other objects than commits is possible, but rather "unusual".


-h, --help::
	Print usage summary.

--long-help::
	Print user manual. The same as found in gitlink:cg-tag[1].
