cg-rm(1)
========

NAME
----
cg-rm - remove files from the repository

SYNOPSIS
--------
cg-rm [-a] [-f] [-n] [-r] FILE...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Takes a list of file names at the command line, and schedules them
for removal from the GIT repository at the next commit. Those files
are denoted by 'D' in the gitlink:cg-status[1] list. You can remove gitlink:cg-add[1]ed
files to undo the addition; you can undo removals in an analogous way
using gitlink:cg-add[1] and restore files deleted from the working copy using
gitlink:cg-restore[1].

OPTIONS
-------

--
-a::
	Record removal of all files which have been deleted from
	the working copy. Useful when there were some random files
	added/removed (e.g. by some third-party application) and you
	want to get the repository in sync: just use
	`cg-rm -a && cg-add -a`.

-f::
	Also delete the files from the tree physically.

-n::
	Do not delete the files from the tree physically, if they are
	still there. So it effectively just makes Cogito to stop caring
	about the file. This is the default.

-r::
	If you pass cg-rm this flag and any directory names, it will try
	to remove files in those directories recursively.


-h, --help::
	Print usage summary.

--long-help::
	Print user manual. The same as found in gitlink:cg-rm[1].
