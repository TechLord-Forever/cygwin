cg-seek(1)
==========

NAME
----
cg-seek - seek the working tree to a given commit

SYNOPSIS
--------
cg-seek [COMMIT_ID]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Seeking will bring the working tree from its current 'HEAD' to a given
commit. Note that it changes just the 'HEAD' of the working tree, not
the branch it is corresponding to. It will return to the 'HEAD' of
the appropriate branch if passed no arguments.

Therefore, for a quick excursion to the past of the 'master' branch:

	$ cg-seek git pasky-0.1
	$ cg-diff this master	# will do the correct thing
	$ cg-seek		# will restore what we had before

For intuitiveness, specifying the branch name (`cg-seek master`) will do
the right thing too. If you want to migrate your working tree to _another_
branch, use gitlink:cg-clone[1] to create a new tree for the new branch, or
gitlink:cg-switch[1] to also change your current tree to use the new branch.

Note that during the time you are seeked out, commits, merges, and some
other operations are blocked, since the next gitlink:cg-seek[1] or gitlink:cg-reset[1]
invocation will happily wipe out their products silently. You can override
this in the gitlink:cg-commit[1] command by passing it a '-f' parameter - this
can be useful e.g. when you seeked to a commit which cannot be compiled
and you want to commit a compilation fix, as long as you are aware that
the commit of the fix will be rendered unreachable (you will be able to
get back to it only if you remember its ID) at the moment you do next
seek or a reset. If you want to save the commit, you can save it to
a separate branch using `cg-switch -n`.

Takes the target commit ID to seek to as an argument.

NOTES
-----
The gitlink:cg-seek[1] command is meant only for temporary excursions to the commit
history. If you want to permanently switch your branch to a different commit
id (forgetting its current contents), you can use the gitlink:cg-switch[1] command:

	$ cg-switch -f -r COMMIT_ID CURRENT_HEAD_NAME

Note that this command has some serious caveats! Please read the
gitlink:cg-switch[1] documentation for details.
