cg-add(1)
=========

NAME
----
cg-add - add new files to the repository

SYNOPSIS
--------
cg-add [-a] [-N] [-r] FILE...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Takes a list of file names at the command line, and schedules them
for addition to the GIT repository at the next commit. Those files
are denoted by 'A' in the gitlink:cg-status[1] list. You can add gitlink:cg-rm[1]oved
files to undo the removal (use gitlink:cg-restore[1] if the file is already
deleted from the working copy as well); you can undo additions in
an analogous way using gitlink:cg-rm[1].

The command will fail if one of the given files does not exist.

Note that directories never have to be added to the repository, and are
not tracked on their own. That means, you cannot currently add an empty
directory to 'Cogito'. The reason for this is that 'Cogito' manages
content and empty directories have no content. Directories are added
automatically when adding files inside them, or you can add all files in
a directory using cg-add -r.

OPTIONS
-------

--
-a::
	Add all files in the repository that are currently untracked. Useful
	when there were some random files added/removed (e.g. by some
	third-party application) and you want to get the repository in sync:
	just use `cg-rm -a && cg-add -a`. Note that contrary to `cg-add -r .`,
	this will not re-add gitlink:cg-rm[1]oved files.

-N::
	Only update the cache: do not copy the data into the object database.
	This is for special purposes when you might not actually _have_ any
	object database. This option is normally not interesting.

-r::
	If you pass cg-add this flag and any directory names, it will try
	to add files in those directories recursively (with regard to your
	ignore rules - see gitlink:cg-status[1] for a more detailed description of
	those). See also above for more notes about cg-add vs. directories.


-h, --help::
	Print usage summary.

--long-help::
	Print user manual. The same as found in gitlink:cg-add[1].
