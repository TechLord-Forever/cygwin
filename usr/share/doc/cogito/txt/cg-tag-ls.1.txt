OUTPUT FORMAT
-------------
The first column contains flag letters. The 'S' flag means that the tag is
GPG-signed, the '%' flag means that this is a "direct tag" (does not point
to a tag object; this is now considered deprecated and you might have trouble
distributing the tag to others). The '!' flag means that the tag is broken
and points to a non-existing object.

The second column shows the tag name, the third column its (abbreviated)
object id and the fourth column the first line of tag description,
if applicable.
