=================

NAME
----
cg-admin-lsobj - list unpacked objects in the repository

SYNOPSIS
--------
cg-admin-lsobj [OBJECT_TYPE]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Lists IDs of all the objects of a given type found in the dircache.
Takes the object type as the first parameter, defaults to all objects.

WARNING! This command does not list packed objects, so its usefulness
is rather limited right now. That's a big TODO.

The possible object types are:

blob::
	This object is a pure storage object containing some user data.

commit::
	This object ties directory hierarchies together into a DAG
	of revisions.

tree::
	This object is an object that ties one or more `blob` objects
	into a directory structure.

tag::
	This object ties a symbolic release tag to an object in the
	database.

See the git README for more information about the object types.

OPTIONS
-------

--



-h, --help::
	Print usage summary.

--long-help::
	Print user manual. The same as found in gitlink:cg-admin-lsobj[1].

EXAMPLE USAGE
-------------
Oh, I was messing with my HEADs and lost few commits, where on the earth
could they be...?

	for i in `cg-admin-lsobj commit | cut -f 1`; do
		echo -e "\n==================\nme $i"; cat-file commit $i;
	done
