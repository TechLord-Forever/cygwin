cg-help(1)
==========

NAME
----
cg-help - show help for cogito commands

SYNOPSIS
--------
cg-help [-c] [cg-COMMAND | COMMAND]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Takes an optional argument describing the command to show the help for.
The command can be specified either as 'COMMAND' or 'cg-COMMAND'.
If the argument is left out an overview of all the Cogito commands will
be shown.

Note, short help for a command is also available by passing `--help` or
`-h` to the command. The complete command manual is shown when passing
`--long-help` (and is the same as doing "`cg-help command`").

OPTIONS
-------

--
-c::
	Colorize the output. You can customize the colors using the
	$CG_COLORS environment variable (see below).


-h, --help::
	Print usage summary.

--long-help::
	Print user manual. The same as found in gitlink:cg-help[1].

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
PAGER::
	The pager to display log information in, defaults to `less`.

PAGER_FLAGS::
	Flags to pass to the pager.

CG_COLORS::
	Colon-separated list of 'name=color' pairs, where name is
	one of helpcopy, helpusage, helpsection, helplitem, helpcgcmd,
	helpcode, helpempth, default, and value is an ECMA-48 SGR
	sequence (see e.g. console_codes(4)).

CG_COLORS_AUTO::
	Even if -c was passed or specified in ~/.cgrc, if this option
	is set, use colors only when the output is a terminal and it
	supports colors.

CG_LESS::
	This is what the $LESS environment variable value will be set
	to before invoking $PAGER. It defaults to $LESS concatenated
	with the `R` flag to allow displaying of colorized output.

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
-----------------------
The following GIT configuration file variables are recognized:

help.usecolor::
	If enabled, colorify the output like with -c if the output
	is a terminal.
