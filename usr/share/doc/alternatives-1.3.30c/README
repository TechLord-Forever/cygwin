The latest version of this customized package is available from
<URL:http://www.fastcoder.net/~thumper/software/sysadmin/chkconfig/>.
The original source RPM is available from the Fedora Core project.

This code is based on chkconfig-1.3.30 from the Fedora Core 6
distribution.  It has been modified to add GNU configure, allowing
for easier compilation on other platforms.

If you have problems with file globbing, most likely you need to
create the rc directories used by sysv init.  eg:
   /etc/rc.d/rc0.d/
   /etc/rc.d/rc1.d/
   /etc/rc.d/rc2.d/
   /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/
   /etc/rc.d/rc4.d/
   /etc/rc.d/rc5.d/
   /etc/rc.d/rc6.d/
If you have those directories in a different location, try using
the "--with-rc-dir" option to configure.  Or, you can use the
"--rc.d" option to chkconfig itself.  There is partial support
for using only levels 0-3; drop me an email with any problems
you are experiencing if you have this situation.


Once you've compiled it, chkconfig requires special headers
at the top of the init scripts in order to know how to setup
the symlinks.  This is documented in the manpage for chkconfig.
