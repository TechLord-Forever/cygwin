The following output formats are {\em directly\/} supported by doxygen: \begin{description}
\item[{\bf HTML} ]Generated if {\tt GENERATE\_\-HTML} is set to {\tt YES} in the configuration file. \item[$\mbox{\LaTeX}$ ]Generated if {\tt GENERATE\_\-LATEX} is set to {\tt YES} in the configuration file. \item[{\bf Man pages} ]Generated if {\tt GENERATE\_\-MAN} is set to {\tt YES} in the configuration file. \item[{\bf RTF} ]Generated if {\tt GENERATE\_\-RTF} is set to {\tt YES} in the configuration file.

Note that the RTF output probably only looks nice with Microsoft's Word 97. If you have success with other programs, please let me know. \item[{\bf XML} ]Generated if {\tt GENERATE\_\-XML} is set to {\tt YES} in the configuration file.

Note that the XML output is still under development. \end{description}


The following output formats are {\em indirectly\/} supported by doxygen: \begin{description}
\item[{\bf Compiled HTML Help} (a.k.a. Windows 98 help) ]Generated by Microsoft's HTML Help workshop from the HTML output if {\tt GENERATE\_\-HTMLHELP} is set to {\tt YES}. \item[{\bf PostScript} ]Generated from the $\mbox{\LaTeX}$ output by running {\tt make ps} in the output directory. For the best results {\tt PDF\_\-HYPERLINKS} should be set to {\tt NO}. \item[{\bf PDF} ]Generated from the $\mbox{\LaTeX}$ output by running {\tt make pdf} in the output directory. To improve the PDF output, you typically would want to enable the use of {\tt pdflatex} by setting \hyperlink{config_cfg_use_pdflatex}{USE\_\-PDFLATEX} to {\tt YES} in the configuration file. In order to get hyperlinks in the PDF file you also need to enable \hyperlink{config_cfg_pdf_hyperlinks}{PDF\_\-HYPERLINKS}. \end{description}
