NAME
----
stg-init - stgdesc:init[]

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'stg' init

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Initialise the current GIT branch to be used as an StGIT stack.  You
must already be in a GIT repository and .git/HEAD must point to a
valid file in refs/heads/.

This operation is for example suitable to start working using the
"development branch" workflow (see gitlink:stg[1]).  Other means to setup
an StGIT stack are stglink:clone[] and the '--create' and '--clone'
commands of stglink:branch[].

StGIT
-----
Part of the StGIT suite - see gitlink:stg[1].
