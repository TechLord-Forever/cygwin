Ccdoc is a free javadoc inspired tool that automatically generates
HTML web documentation from C++ programs by parsing the source file
headers. It was designed to aid collaboration between package users
and package developers by documenting the interface.

Complete information about this tool, including the users guide and
FAQ can be found on the project home page: http://ccdoc.sourceforge.net.

This distribution consists of a single executable: ccdoc and a single
man page: ccdoc.1 (ccdoc.man in the source directory).

Here is how you can create the program and install it in /usr/bin
and install the man page in /usr/share/man/man1/ccdoc.1.

  % cd sources/ccdoc-${MAJOR}.${MINOR}-1
  % make install
