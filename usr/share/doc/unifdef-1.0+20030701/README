unifdef
-------

unifdef originally appeared in BSD from sources contributed by Dave
Yost.  This package is a port of the FreeBSD version maintained by
Tony Finch <dot@dotat.at>.  Documentation for unifdef is provided
in the man page.

Build Note: The FreeBSD sources are typically not built standalone.
To build 'unifdef' by itself outside of the BSD framework I modified the
program build environment to use the GNU autoconf and automake tools.
I included the 'strlcpy' library.  Additionally I added a simple test
framework with a few small regression cases.

As authorized by
  ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/4bsd/README.Impt.License.Change I have
removed the BSD advertising clause.  If unavailable at that location a
copy has been saved with the Debian package source.

The FreeBSD page is:

The sources for unifdef are available here:
